# ESP32-TMC2208-MicroPython-Driver
This is a driver I've written in MicroPython for the ESP-WROOM-32 to interface with the TMC2208 v3.0 UART to interface with a NEMA motor.

To be specific, this is a really basic driver to help anyone move their NEMA motor with this setup. I found drivers written in C for the standard Arduino environment, but I didn't want to use C for my "just for fun" project.
